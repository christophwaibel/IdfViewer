# IDF_Viewer
IDF Viewer to view geometries of idf files from EnergyPlus!

## Using it 
Repo not cleaned up and code not yet working. Several years old and I have no idea, how I ran it. Eclipse? Directly in Processing? But... The .exe should work, in the [examples folder](https://github.com/christophwaibel/IDF_Viewer/tree/master/examples/). Try the 64 bit version, at least that's what's working on my win 10 machine. Extract the content to your desktop, start `sketch_feb25a.exe`. Check out the gifs below. You need to select one or more idf files. Some can be found [here](https://github.com/christophwaibel/IDF_Viewer/tree/master/examples/_example files to load).
